## 🧠 **Hierarchy of Growth (from slowest to fastest):**

This helps you understand which function "dominates" or "grows faster" as $x \to \infty$

| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | **Constant**        | $5, \ 42, \ \pi$          | Doesn't grow with $x$; always fixed                     |
| 2️⃣  | **Logarithmic**     | $\ln x,\ \log_{10} x$     | Grows **very slowly**; slower than any power            |
| 3️⃣  | **Polynomial root** | $\sqrt{x},\ x^{1/n}$      | Grows faster than log, but slower than full polynomials |
| 4️⃣  | **Polynomial**      | $x, \ x^2, \ x^3$         | Medium growth; degree matters                           |
| 5️⃣  | **Exponential**     | $2^x,\ e^x,\ 10^x$        | Grows **much faster** than any polynomial               |
| 6️⃣  | **Factorial**       | $x!,\ n!$                 | Grows **even faster** than exponentials                 |
| 7️⃣  | **Power Tower**     | $x^x,\ a^{x^2},\ e^{e^x}$ | Grows **extremely fast** – faster than all the rest     |

### Extra Intuition:

* **Constant**: Doesn’t change, like 5.
* **Logarithmic**: Grows very slowly even as $x \to \infty$.
* **Root**: Grows faster than log, but slower than linear.
* **Polynomial**: Depends on the power. $x^2$ grows slower than $x^3$, etc.
* **Exponential**: Shoots up rapidly, e.g., $2^x$, $e^x$.
* **Factorial**: Grows faster than exponentials (e.g., $5! = 120$, $10! = 3,628,800$).
* **Power Tower**: Explodes in size! $x^x$, $x^{x^x}$, etc.

Let me know if you'd like a **graphical intuition**, **real-life analogy**, or **limit comparison examples** between them.

Great! Let's understand what **continuity** means in simple terms — no jargon, just intuition + math when needed.

---

### 🎯 **Continuity (Simple Idea)**

A function is **continuous at a point** if:

> ❗ You can draw its graph at that point **without lifting your pen**.

That’s it — no jumps, no holes, no breaks.

---

### 🧠 More formally, a function $f(x)$ is **continuous at a point $x = a$** if all 3 of these are true:

1. ✅ $f(a)$ is **defined** (the point exists).
2. ✅ The **limit** $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ **exists**.
3. ✅ The value of the function **equals** the limit:

   $$
   \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)
   $$

---

### 📈 Visually:

* **Continuous**: The graph is smooth at that point.
* **Discontinuous**: The graph has a **jump**, **hole**, or **asymptote**.

---

### 🔍 Types of discontinuities:

1. **Jump discontinuity** – sudden jump in the graph.
2. **Hole/removable** – a missing point (like dividing by 0).
3. **Infinite/discontinuity** – graph shoots to ∞ or −∞.

---

### ✅ Examples:

* $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ — **Continuous** everywhere.
* $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ — Not continuous at $x = 0$ (because undefined there).
* Piecewise-defined functions may or may not be continuous at the point where the pieces switch.

---

Would you like to see examples of both **continuous and discontinuous graphs** or how to check continuity in a **piecewise** function?
---

Let’s break this problem down clearly and calmly.

---

### ❓ **Given:**

A piecewise function:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
x + a & \text{if } x < 2 \\
ax^2 - 3 & \text{if } x \geq 2
\end{cases}
$$

You're asked to **find all values of $a$** such that **$f(x)$ is continuous** on the entire real line (i.e., from $-\infty$ to $\infty$).

---

### ✅ Step-by-step explanation:

For a piecewise function to be **continuous** everywhere, especially at the point where the pieces **change** (i.e., **at $x = 2$**), you must ensure:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = f(2)
$$

So we’ll **calculate both limits** and make them equal.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Left-hand limit ($x \to 2^-$)

Use the **first piece** $f(x) = x + a$:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 2 + a
$$

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Right-hand limit ($x \to 2^+$)

Use the **second piece** $f(x) = ax^2 - 3$:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = a(2)^2 - 3 = 4a - 3
$$

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Set both equal (continuity condition):

$$
2 + a = 4a - 3
$$

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Solve for $a$:

$$
2 + a = 4a - 3 \\
2 + 3 = 4a - a \\
5 = 3a \Rightarrow a = \frac{5}{3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{a = \frac{5}{3}}
$$

This is the **only value of $a$** that makes the function **continuous** on the entire real number line.

Let me know if you’d like a **graph sketch** or **intuitive analogy** to help you remember how this works.

---

Great question! Let’s break it down clearly and simply.

---

### ❓Why is a **polynomial function** always continuous?

---

### ✅ What is a **polynomial**?

A polynomial is a function made of terms like this:

$$
f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0
$$

Examples:

* $f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1$
* $f(x) = x^5 - 4x^3 + 7$

---

### ✅ Why are they continuous?

Because **all the operations** used in polynomials are continuous:

* Addition ✅
* Subtraction ✅
* Multiplication ✅
* Powers with whole-number exponents ✅

So, no matter what $x$ you choose, the output $f(x)$ can be calculated **smoothly without any jumps, holes, or breaks**.

---

### 🧠 Intuition:

You can **draw** a polynomial curve **without lifting your pen** from the paper.
That’s exactly what it means to be continuous.

---

### 🚫 What causes discontinuity then?

Functions like:

* Piecewise functions (where definitions change at a point)
* Rational functions (division — can cause undefined values)
* Functions with roots or logs (which have domain restrictions)

Polynomials **don’t involve division or undefined zones** — that’s why they’re always continuous.

---

### ✅ Summary:

Polynomials are continuous **everywhere** on $(-\infty, \infty)$ because they are built from basic continuous operations that never "break" or become undefined.

Let me know if you want a **visual graph comparison** or want to contrast this with **non-continuous functions**.
