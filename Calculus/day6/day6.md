Sure! Here's your content rewritten clearly in **bullet points** for easier understanding and quick review:

---

### ✅ **Concave Up (Concave Upward)**

* **Definition**: A function is concave up on an interval if its graph curves upward like a cup or a smile.
* **Second Derivative**:

  * If $f''(x) > 0$, the function is concave up on that interval.
* **Tangent Line Behavior**:

  * Tangent lines lie **below** the curve.
* **Rate of Change**:

  * The slopes of the tangent lines are **increasing** from left to right.
* **Example**:

  * The graph of $f(x) = x^2$ is concave up over its entire domain.

---

### 🔻 **Concave Down (Concave Downward)**

* **Definition**: A function is concave down on an interval if its graph curves downward like an upside-down cup.
* **Second Derivative**:

  * If $f''(x) < 0$, the function is concave down on that interval.
* **Tangent Line Behavior**:

  * Tangent lines lie **above** the curve.
* **Rate of Change**:

  * The slopes of the tangent lines are **decreasing** from left to right.
* **Example**:

  * The graph of $g(x) = -x^2$ is concave down over its entire domain.

---

### ⚡ **Point of Inflection**

* **Definition**: A point where the graph **changes concavity** (from concave up to down or vice versa).
* **Second Derivative Condition**:

  * At an inflection point, $f''(x) = 0$ or $f''(x)$ is undefined.
* **Important Note**:

  * Just having $f''(x) = 0$ is **not enough**.
  * You must check that the sign of $f''(x)$ **actually changes** around that point.

---

### 🎨 **Visualizing Concavity**

* Think of:

  * ☕ A **cup** (U-shape) for **concave up**
  * 🕳️ An **upside-down cup** (∩-shape) for **concave down**

---

The **Second Derivative Test** is a method in calculus used to determine whether a **critical point** (where $f'(x) = 0$) is a **local maximum, local minimum**, or **neither**, based on the second derivative $f''(x)$.

---

### 🧪 **Second Derivative Test (for functions of one variable)**

Let $f(x)$ be a function such that:

* $f'(x_0) = 0$ (i.e., $x_0$ is a critical point), and
* $f''(x_0)$ exists.

Then:

1. 🔼 **If** $f''(x_0) > 0$:
   → $f(x)$ has a **local minimum** at $x = x_0$
   (The curve is **concave up** at that point — like a "U" shape)

2. 🔽 **If** $f''(x_0) < 0$:
   → $f(x)$ has a **local maximum** at $x = x_0$
   (The curve is **concave down** at that point — like an "∩" shape)

3. ❓ **If** $f''(x_0) = 0$:
   → The test is **inconclusive**.
   You must use other methods (like the First Derivative Test or analyzing further derivatives).

---

### 🔍 Quick Example:

Let’s say $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4$

1. First derivative:
   $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x$

2. Critical points:
   Set $f'(x) = 0$ → $3x(x - 2) = 0$ → $x = 0, 2$

3. Second derivative:
   $f''(x) = 6x - 6$

   * At $x = 0$: $f''(0) = -6$ → **local maximum**
   * At $x = 2$: $f''(2) = 6$ → **local minimum**

---

Great question! Let’s go over how to find **local maxima and minima using the First Derivative Test** — no second derivative needed.

---

### 🔹 **First Derivative Test** — Step-by-Step

Suppose you have a function $f(x)$, and you want to find **local maxima or minima**:

---

### ✅ **Steps:**

1. **Find the critical points:**

   * Take the first derivative: $f'(x)$
   * Set it to zero: $f'(x) = 0$
   * Solve for $x$ → These are your **critical points** (where the slope is zero).

2. **Make a sign chart around each critical point:**

   * Pick values **just before and just after** each critical point.
   * Plug them into $f'(x)$ to see if the slope is **positive or negative**.

3. **Analyze the sign changes:**

   * If $f'(x)$ changes from **positive to negative** at $x = c$:
     → **Local Maximum** at $x = c$

   * If $f'(x)$ changes from **negative to positive** at $x = c$:
     → **Local Minimum** at $x = c$

   * If **no sign change**:
     → **Neither maximum nor minimum** (could be an inflection point or flat region)

---

### 🧪 Example:

Let $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2$

1. First derivative:
   $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x$

2. Critical points:
   $3x(x - 2) = 0$ → $x = 0$, $x = 2$

3. Sign chart:

   * Pick a value **< 0**, say $x = -1$:
     $f'(-1) = 3(-1)^2 - 6(-1) = 3 + 6 = 9$ → **positive**

   * Between 0 and 2, say $x = 1$:
     $f'(1) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) = 3 - 6 = -3$ → **negative**

   * After 2, say $x = 3$:
     $f'(3) = 3(3)^2 - 6(3) = 27 - 18 = 9$ → **positive**

4. Result:

   * At $x = 0$: $f'(x)$ changes from **positive to negative** → **Local Max**
   * At $x = 2$: $f'(x)$ changes from **negative to positive** → **Local Min**

---

Yes! You're absolutely on the right track. Let me break it down super clearly and visually in steps so you understand **why the sign change happens** and **how it tells us about local maxima and minima.**

---

### 🔁 The Idea Behind the First Derivative Test:

We check the **sign of the derivative ( $f'(x)$ )** just **before and after** the critical point.

Why?

Because the sign of $f'(x)$ tells you if the function is **increasing** or **decreasing**.

* $f'(x) > 0$: Function is increasing (going up)
* $f'(x) < 0$: Function is decreasing (going down)

Now let's revisit your function:

---

### Function: $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2$

**Step 1: Find the derivative**
$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x = 3x(x - 2)$

Set $f'(x) = 0$:
→ $3x(x - 2) = 0$
→ Critical points: $x = 0$, $x = 2$

---

### Step 2: Sign Check — Around Critical Points

We divide the number line based on critical points:

| Interval    | Test Point | $f'(x) = 3x(x - 2)$ | Sign  | Meaning    |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| $x < 0$     | $x = -1$   | $3(-1)(-3) = 9$     | **+** | Increasing |
| $0 < x < 2$ | $x = 1$    | $3(1)(-1) = -3$     | **−** | Decreasing |
| $x > 2$     | $x = 3$    | $3(3)(1) = 9$       | **+** | Increasing |

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Sign Change

* At **$x = 0$**:

  * Before: Positive → After: Negative
  * So function **increases before** and **decreases after** → **Local Max**

* At **$x = 2$**:

  * Before: Negative → After: Positive
  * So function **decreases before** and **increases after** → **Local Min**

---

### 📌 Intuition:

You're not checking **exactly** at $x = 0$, you're checking **what happens just before and just after** — like a small neighborhood.

* Just before 0 (e.g., −1): slope is +ve → increasing
* Just after 0 (e.g., 1): slope is −ve → decreasing
  → So the graph goes ⬆️ then ⬇️ ⇒ Local Max at $x = 0$

---

Great! Let’s break it down **simply** and step by step.

---

### 🧠 **What is a Point of Inflection?**

A **point of inflection** is where the **shape of a curve changes** — from:

* **Concave Up** (like a cup: ⭡) → to **Concave Down** (like a cap: ⭣),
  or vice versa.

In simple words:
👉 It’s where the **curve bends the other way** — the "curving direction" changes.

---

### 🔍 How to Find a Point of Inflection (Steps)

Let $f(x)$ be a function.

1. **Find the second derivative**: $f''(x)$

2. **Set $f''(x) = 0$** and solve it.
   These are the **possible inflection points**.

3. **Check sign change of $f''(x)$** around each solution:

   * Pick a point **before** and **after** each root.
   * If $f''(x)$ changes sign (**positive ↔ negative**),
     then that point is a **point of inflection**.

---

### ✅ Example:

Let’s take $f(x) = x^3$

1. $f'(x) = 3x^2$
2. $f''(x) = 6x$

Set $f''(x) = 0$ → $6x = 0$ → $x = 0$

Now check:

* Before 0 (say $x = -1$): $f''(-1) = -6$ → Negative
* After 0 (say $x = 1$): $f''(1) = +6$ → Positive

✅ So, $f''(x)$ changes sign ⇒
📍 **$x = 0$ is a point of inflection**.

---

### 📌 Visual Meaning:

If you draw the graph of $x^3$, it changes its **curve direction** at $x = 0$.

---

Excellent question! Let’s explore **why we use $f''(x)$ (the second derivative)** instead of $f'(x)$ when finding **points of inflection**.

---

### 🔹 1. What does $f'(x)$ (first derivative) tell us?

* $f'(x)$ gives the **slope** of the function.
* If $f'(x) > 0$ → the function is **increasing**.
* If $f'(x) < 0$ → the function is **decreasing**.
* Used for finding **maxima**, **minima**, and **increasing/decreasing** behavior.

📌 But it doesn’t tell us **how the curve is bending**.

---

### 🔹 2. What does $f''(x)$ (second derivative) tell us?

* It gives the **rate of change of the slope** — i.e., how the slope is changing.
* In simple words, it tells whether the **graph is curving upward or downward**.

| $f''(x) > 0$ | Curve is **concave up** (like a bowl)   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| $f''(x) < 0$ | Curve is **concave down** (like a hill) |

So when **( f''(x) changes sign**, it means:
➡️ The **concavity** is changing
➡️ The **bending direction** is changing
➡️ That’s what defines a **point of inflection**

---

### ✅ Why not use $f'(x)$?

Because $f'(x)$ only tells us if the graph is going up or down —
It **doesn’t say** whether the graph is **bending up or down**.

To detect changes in the curve’s *bending direction*, we need the **second derivative**.

---

### 🔧 Simple Analogy:

Think of driving a car:

* $f(x)$: Your **position** on the road.
* $f'(x)$: Your **speed**.
* $f''(x)$: Your **acceleration** (are you speeding up or slowing down).

But inflection is like asking:
➡️ Are you turning left and then suddenly right?
➡️ That’s a **change in curve direction** → You need to look at acceleration, not just speed.

---

Ah, got it! You want the **deep intuition** — like **why exactly** the **second derivative** $f''(x)$ is used for **point of inflection**, and **why the first derivative $f'(x)$ isn’t enough**. Let's make it crystal clear with real-world feeling and logic:

---

## 🔍 The Intuition:

### 💡 First Derivative $f'(x)$:

* Tells us **if the function is going up or down**.
* It **does not** tell us **how the curve is bending**.

For example, both of these can be **increasing**:

* 📈 Going up and **curving upward**.
* 📈 Going up and **curving downward**.

So, just knowing if it’s going up or down (i.e., $f'(x)$) is **not enough** to know **how the shape is changing**.

---

### 📐 Second Derivative $f''(x)$:

* Tells us how the **slope itself is changing**.
* That is, is the graph **curving upward (concave up)** or **curving downward (concave down)**?

And here’s the key:

👉 A **point of inflection** happens when the **curve switches**:

* from curving up ⭡ to curving down ⭣
* or from curving down ⭣ to curving up ⭡

This change in **concavity** is **exactly what $f''(x)$ measures**.

---

### 🔧 Think of it like this:

Imagine the graph is a road, and you’re driving:

* $f(x)$ is your position
* $f'(x)$ is your speed (going up or down a hill)
* $f''(x)$ is your **steering wheel turning**:

  * If it's turned left: concave up
  * If it's turned right: concave down
  * If your steering switches direction → **you crossed a point of inflection**

---

### ❌ Why $f'(x)$ alone can’t help:

You could be:

* Going **up** the hill (positive slope)
* Then still going **up**, but **not as fast** (slope decreasing)
* Then you might start going **down** (negative slope)

👉 This tells you when the function peaks (max/min), **but not** whether the graph **changed curvature**.

In fact, the **slope could be increasing or decreasing** without the curve actually "bending" the other way.

---

### ✅ Only $f''(x)$ tells you:

> Is the graph **curving in one way**, then **curving the other way**?

That’s the **definition** of an inflection point.

---

### ⚡ Final Punchline:

> A point of inflection is about the **shape of the curve**, not the direction it moves.
> Only the **second derivative** can "see" how the shape bends.

---


BASIC DEFINITIONS

### **Perimeter**

The **perimeter** of a shape is the **total distance around it**.
You imagine walking all the way along the outline of the shape — that distance is the perimeter.

---

### 📍 For a rectangle:

The perimeter means **the distance around all four sides**.
So, if you walk along:

1. One long side
2. One short side
3. The other long side
4. The other short side
   ...and add up all those distances — you get the perimeter.

---

Okay — let’s keep it simple without formulas.

Alright ✅
I’ll give you **GATE-focused Integration e-notes** with:

1. **All important formulas**
2. **Why we add “+ C” in indefinite integration** (explained clearly so you never forget)

---

# **📚 Integration – GATE Exam Notes**

---

## **1. Why Do We Add “+ C” in Indefinite Integrals?**

When we integrate a function, we are doing the **reverse** of differentiation.

Example:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x  
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 5) = 2x  
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 100) = 2x  
$$

All three have the **same derivative** $2x$.

So when we integrate $2x$, we don’t know whether the original function had **+5**, **-100**, or any other constant — they all vanish when differentiated.

Hence:

$$
\int 2x \, dx = x^2 + C
$$

Here **C** = constant of integration, representing all possible constants the original function could have had.

**Key point:**

* **+C** is added in **indefinite integrals only** (not in definite integrals because limits remove constants).
* If you **forget C**, your answer is **not general**.

If you want, I can prepare a **one-page A4 GATE Integration Formula Sheet** with all formulas in a **visually optimized format** so you can revise in 2 minutes before the exam.

Got it — you’re asking how to solve the integral of $10^u \, du$.

---

### Step-by-step:

We know the general formula:

$$
\int a^x \, dx = \frac{a^x}{\ln a} + C, \quad a > 0, a \neq 1
$$

Here, $a = 10$ and $x = u$.

---

**Step 1:** Apply the formula

$$
\int 10^u \, du = \frac{10^u}{\ln 10} + C
$$

---

✅ **Final answer:**

$$
\boxed{\frac{10^u}{\ln 10} + C}
$$

---

You’re asking for $\int \log x \, dx$.

---

**Step 1 — Recall the integration formula**
Here we use integration by parts:

Let:

$$
u = \log x \quad\Rightarrow\quad du = \frac{1}{x} dx
$$

$$
dv = dx \quad\Rightarrow\quad v = x
$$

---

**Step 2 — Apply integration by parts formula**

$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
$$

Substitute:

$$
\int \log x \, dx = x \log x - \int x \cdot \frac{1}{x} dx
$$

$$
= x \log x - \int 1 \, dx
$$

---

**Step 3 — Solve**

$$
= x \log x - x + C
$$

---

✅ **Final answer:**

$$
\boxed{\int \log x \, dx = x \log x - x + C}
$$

---


Alright, here’s your solution rewritten cleanly in the same logical order:

---

We need to evaluate:

$$
\int_{1}^{4} x f''(x) \, dx
$$

Given:

$$
f(1) = 2,\quad f(4) = 7,\quad f'(1) = 5,\quad f'(4) = 3,\quad f''(x) \ \text{is continuous.}
$$

---

**Step 1: Apply integration by parts**
Formula:

$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
$$

Let:

$$
u = x \quad\Rightarrow\quad du = dx
$$

$$
dv = f''(x) dx \quad\Rightarrow\quad v = f'(x)
$$

---

**Step 2: Substitution into the formula**

$$
\int_{1}^{4} x f''(x) \, dx = \left[ x f'(x) \right]_{1}^{4} - \int_{1}^{4} f'(x) \, dx
$$

---

**Step 3: Evaluate the boundary term**

$$
\left[ x f'(x) \right]_{1}^{4} = (4 \cdot f'(4)) - (1 \cdot f'(1)) = (4 \cdot 3) - (1 \cdot 5) = 12 - 5 = 7
$$

---

**Step 4: Evaluate the remaining integral**
Since $\int f'(x) dx = f(x)$,

$$
\int_{1}^{4} f'(x) \, dx = f(4) - f(1) = 7 - 2 = 5
$$

---

**Step 5: Final calculation**

$$
\int_{1}^{4} x f''(x) \, dx = 7 - 5 = 2
$$

✅ **Final Answer:** $\boxed{2}$

Got it — you want to evaluate

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{0} e^x \sin x \, dx
$$

---

### Step 1: Recall the standard formula

For $a^x \sin(bx)$ type integrals (or $e^{ax} \sin(bx)$), we have:

$$
\int e^{ax} \sin(bx) \, dx = \frac{e^{ax}}{a^2 + b^2} \left( a \sin(bx) - b \cos(bx) \right) + C
$$

Here:

$$
a = 1,\quad b = 1
$$

So:

$$
\int e^x \sin x \, dx = \frac{e^x}{1^2 + 1^2} \left( 1 \sin x - 1 \cos x \right) = \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin x - \cos x) + C
$$

---

### Step 2: Apply limits from $-\infty$ to $0$

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{0} e^x \sin x \, dx = \left[ \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin x - \cos x) \right]_{-\infty}^{0}
$$

* At $x = 0$:

$$
\frac{e^0}{2} (\sin 0 - \cos 0) = \frac{1}{2} (0 - 1) = -\frac{1}{2}
$$

* At $x \to -\infty$:
  Since $e^x \to 0$ as $x \to -\infty$,

$$
\frac{e^x}{2} (\sin x - \cos x) \to 0
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{0} e^x \sin x \, dx = \left(-\frac12\right) - 0 = -\frac12
$$

---

✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{-\frac12}
$$

Alright — let's evaluate

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \cos x \, dx
$$

---

### Step 1: Recall the standard formula

For

$$
\int e^{ax} \cos(bx) \, dx
$$

we have:

$$
\int e^{ax} \cos(bx) \, dx = \frac{e^{ax}}{a^2 + b^2} \left( a \cos(bx) + b \sin(bx) \right) + C
$$

---

### Step 2: Apply with $a = -1$, $b = 1$

$$
\int e^{-x} \cos x \, dx = \frac{e^{-x}}{(-1)^2 + (1)^2} \left( -1 \cos x + 1 \sin x \right)
$$

$$
= \frac{e^{-x}}{2} \left( -\cos x + \sin x \right) + C
$$

---

### Step 3: Apply limits $0$ to $\infty$

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \cos x \, dx = \left[ \frac{e^{-x}}{2} \left( -\cos x + \sin x \right) \right]_{0}^{\infty}
$$

* As $x \to \infty$: $e^{-x} \to 0$, so the term → 0.
* At $x = 0$:

$$
\frac{e^{0}}{2} \left( -\cos 0 + \sin 0 \right) = \frac{1}{2}(-1 + 0) = -\frac12
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \cos x \, dx = 0 - \left(-\frac12\right) = \frac12
$$

---

✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\frac12}
$$
