Sure! Here's your content rewritten clearly in **bullet points** for easier understanding and quick review:

---

### ✅ **Concave Up (Concave Upward)**

* **Definition**: A function is concave up on an interval if its graph curves upward like a cup or a smile.
* **Second Derivative**:

  * If $f''(x) > 0$, the function is concave up on that interval.
* **Tangent Line Behavior**:

  * Tangent lines lie **below** the curve.
* **Rate of Change**:

  * The slopes of the tangent lines are **increasing** from left to right.
* **Example**:

  * The graph of $f(x) = x^2$ is concave up over its entire domain.

### 🔻 **Concave Down (Concave Downward)**

* **Definition**: A function is concave down on an interval if its graph curves downward like an upside-down cup.
* **Second Derivative**:

  * If $f''(x) < 0$, the function is concave down on that interval.
* **Tangent Line Behavior**:

  * Tangent lines lie **above** the curve.
* **Rate of Change**:

  * The slopes of the tangent lines are **decreasing** from left to right.
* **Example**:

  * The graph of $g(x) = -x^2$ is concave down over its entire domain.

### ⚡ **Point of Inflection**

* **Definition**: A point where the graph **changes concavity** (from concave up to down or vice versa).
* **Second Derivative Condition**:

  * At an inflection point, $f''(x) = 0$ or $f''(x)$ is undefined.
* **Important Note**:

  * Just having $f''(x) = 0$ is **not enough**.
  * You must check that the sign of $f''(x)$ **actually changes** around that point.

### 🎨 **Visualizing Concavity**

* Think of:

  * ☕ A **cup** (U-shape) for **concave up**
  * 🕳️ An **upside-down cup** (∩-shape) for **concave down**
