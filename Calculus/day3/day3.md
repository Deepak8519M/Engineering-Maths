Yes ‚Äî you're **exactly right** in your thinking. Let's break it down clearly:

---

### üìò **What is L‚ÄôH√¥pital‚Äôs Rule?**

L‚ÄôH√¥pital‚Äôs Rule is a method used to evaluate **limits** of the form:

* $\frac{0}{0}$
* or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

These are called **indeterminate forms**.

---

### üî¢ **Formal Statement of L‚ÄôH√¥pital‚Äôs Rule:**

If:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{0}{0} \text{ or } \frac{\infty}{\infty}
$$

and if:

* $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are **differentiable near** $x = a$, and
* $g'(x) \neq 0$ near $a$, and
* the limit $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$ **exists**

Then:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

### ‚úÖ So, yes:

> According to **L‚ÄôH√¥pital‚Äôs Rule**, you **differentiate numerator and denominator separately**, then take the limit again.

---

### üß† Important Note:

* You do **not** apply the `u/v` quotient rule here.
* You only use **L‚ÄôH√¥pital's Rule** when the limit gives an indeterminate form (like $\frac{0}{0}$).

---

### üß™ Example:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x}
\Rightarrow \frac{0}{0} \text{ ‚Üí Apply L‚ÄôH√¥pital}
$$

Differentiate top and bottom **separately**:

* $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x$
* $\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1$

So:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos x}{1} = \cos(0) = 1
$$

---

Great observation ‚Äî you're asking:

> ‚ÄúIf I differentiate the numerator and denominator **separately**, like just doing derivative of numerator and derivative of denominator ‚Äî and then divide them ‚Äî is that okay?‚Äù

Short answer: **‚ùå No, that‚Äôs not valid** in general.

---

### üî¥ Why It‚Äôs Not Okay

You're likely thinking something like this:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{u(x)}{v(x)} \right) \overset{?}{=} \frac{u'(x)}{v'(x)}
$$

This is **not true**.

#### Example:

Let‚Äôs test it with:

$$
f(x) = \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1}
$$

**Wrong method:**
Differentiate numerator: $e^x$
Differentiate denominator: $e^x$

So this wrong method gives:

$$
\frac{e^x}{e^x} = 1 \quad \text{(‚ùå Incorrect)}
$$

**Correct method (Quotient Rule):**

$$
f'(x) = \frac{(e^x + 1)(e^x) - e^x(e^x)}{(e^x + 1)^2}
= \frac{e^x}{(e^x + 1)^2}
\quad \text{(‚úÖ Correct)}
$$

So we clearly see:

$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{u}{v} \right) \neq \frac{du}{dx} \div \frac{dv}{dx}}
$$

---

### ‚úÖ When *Can* You Differentiate Numerator & Denominator Separately?

Only in **special limit cases**, such as:

#### 1. **L‚ÄôH√¥pital‚Äôs Rule** (in limits):

If a limit gives $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, then:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
\quad \text{(only under special conditions)}
$$

‚úÖ This is where **derivative of top over derivative of bottom** is valid ‚Äî **but only inside limits.**

---

### üü¢ Summary:

| Case                                        | Is $\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{u}{v} \right) = \frac{u'}{v'}$? |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal derivative (no limit)                | ‚ùå **Not valid** ‚Äì must use quotient rule                      |
| Limit of 0/0 or ‚àû/‚àû form (L‚ÄôH√¥pital‚Äôs Rule) | ‚úÖ **Valid**, but only under limit context                     |

---

Great! Let's break down the **u/v rule**, also called the **quotient rule** in differentiation.

---

### üìò Quotient Rule (u/v Rule)

If you have a function of the form:

$$
f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}
$$

Where:

* $u(x)$ is the **numerator**
* $v(x)$ is the **denominator**

---

### ‚úÖ Then the derivative is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{u}{v} \right) = \frac{v \cdot u' - u \cdot v'}{v^2}
$$

> **Or in words**:
> Denominator √ó Derivative of numerator
> ‚àí Numerator √ó Derivative of denominator
> all over (Denominator)¬≤

---

### üß† Example

Let‚Äôs differentiate:

$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x + 1}
$$

Here:

* $u = x^2 \Rightarrow u' = 2x$
* $v = x + 1 \Rightarrow v' = 1$

Now apply the quotient rule:

$$
f'(x) = \frac{(x + 1)(2x) - (x^2)(1)}{(x + 1)^2}
$$

$$
= \frac{2x(x + 1) - x^2}{(x + 1)^2}
= \frac{2x^2 + 2x - x^2}{(x + 1)^2}
= \frac{x^2 + 2x}{(x + 1)^2}
$$

---

### üîÅ Compare with Product Rule

Quotient rule is like the product rule but for division.
If you find it hard to memorize, here's a trick:

```
(v)(du) - (u)(dv)
---------------
    v¬≤
```

---

Great question! Let's look at your expression:

---

### üìò Expression:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 4}
$$

---

### Step 1: Factor if possible

$$
x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)
$$

So the expression becomes:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x - 2}{(x - 2)(x + 2)}
$$

Now cancel the common term $x - 2$:

$$
= \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{1}{x + 2}
$$

Now substitute $x = 2$:

$$
= \frac{1}{2 + 2} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

---

### ‚ùì Why **didn't** we use the **u/v rule** (quotient rule)?

Because this is **not** a differentiation problem ‚Äî it's a **limit** problem.

We only use the **u/v rule** when we're taking the **derivative** of a function like:

$$
f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}
$$

But here, you're not differentiating ‚Äî you're just simplifying a limit expression. That's why we factor and cancel terms rather than differentiate.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Answer:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 4} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

---

Great question ‚Äî let's break it down **super simply** so it makes complete sense.

---

## üéØ You're asking:

> "In limits, should I use the derivative formula (like u/v rule)? Or can I just do simple steps like cancelling?"

---

### ‚úÖ The **key idea**:

**In limit problems, we only use derivatives (like u/v rule) *if the question asks for it.***
Otherwise, we just **simplify algebraically** (factor, cancel, substitute).

---

### üìå Example:

Let‚Äôs revisit your limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 4}
$$

---

### ‚ú≥ Step-by-step logic (no derivatives here):

#### 1. Notice: $x^2 - 4$ is a difference of squares:

$$
x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)
$$

#### 2. So rewrite:

$$
\frac{x - 2}{(x - 2)(x + 2)} = \frac{1}{x + 2} \quad \text{(cancel } x - 2 \text{)}
$$

#### 3. Now plug in $x = 2$:

$$
\frac{1}{2 + 2} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

---

### ‚ùå So don't use u/v rule here.

That rule is only used when you're doing **derivatives**, like:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}\right)
$$

But your question was a **limit**, not a **derivative**.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

* **Limits:** Use algebra (factor, cancel, substitute).
* **Derivatives:** Use formulas like product rule, chain rule, u/v rule.
